    <h2 class="alignment"> A Place I Would Like to Visit</h2> 
    
      <p class="place-description"> If I could visit any place in the world I would choose to go to Athens, Greece. I would want to go to Athens because in middle school I was reading the Percy Jackson series written by Rick Riordan and I became very interested in Greek mythology. In my interest in Greek mythology I found out that most of the original epics and poems came from Athens, Greece's capital city. In Athens I would want to visit the Acropolis and the Parthenon, these are both places mentioned a lot in the books. Also, Greece is supposed to be a nice place to visit because it is said to be beautiful. </p>

    <h2>A person I admire <br>(past or present)</h2>
    
      <p class="person-description">A person that I admire is J.K. Rowling,<span class="important-point"> most famously known for being the author of the Harry Potter book series.</span> I admire her because she is a very talented author, her first chapter of that series had intrigued me and made me want to read more and every sentence after that was the same feeling. I don't want to be an author when I grow up but throughout high school and college I want to be a good writer. Reading her books made me want to read more and more.</p>
